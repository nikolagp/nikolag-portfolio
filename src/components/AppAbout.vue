            Hi, Iâ€™m Nikola. Frontend developer - self-taught. Eager to explore
            the nature, my open mind and the new technologies. I'm passionate
            about philosophy, art and spirituality. I consider myself to be a
            fast learner, able to grasp new concepts quickly with excellent
            capacity to remember new information. <br /><strong
              >My tech stack in short includes: JavaScript, VueJS and
              WordPress.</strong

                I'll start from high school, when I was writing poetry and
                studied music. Continued with social sciences obtaining BA and
                MA in International law. But also I felt in love with
                philosophy. Founded an NGO but moved to the capital to work for
                another NGO and project coordinator. There I met WordPress and I
                scratched the surface of the tech-world.
                <br />
                So, I quit my job, turned back to my hometown and found a remote
                one - editing and publishing posts on WordPress for a digital
                media company. The job was easy and repeatable. So I started
                freelancing - WordPress websites for friends and clients after I
                was done with the daily tasks. While working with it, besides
                the web development knowledge and design skills I gained, I
                learned CSS and a bit of JavaScript basic concepts. Right before
                the pandemic, I enrolled in a three-month course for Frontend
                development, and then the pandemic happened. I continued with
                studying, but it was more like a hobby. I was aware that
                something should disturb my comfort zone to dive deeply into the
                material.
                <br />
                The new decision was made. I stopped with accepting new WP
                projects, quit my job and bought a 60-hour course for Vanilla
                JavaScript. Since then, I'm learning every day. After that, I
                bought another one, a 20-hour course for VueJS, and among the
                other projects, I was working on this portfolio website.
                <br />
                I'm glad I climbed these steps so far by now. I like this ride,
                so I won't stop here for sure!
